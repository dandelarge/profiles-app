# About the assignment
Components are ready to be used. The Profiles service fetches data from the API for the listing. 

For the details Page, It tries to fetch data from state object. If data is not available, then it returns a mock.

the left side of the Details page is completely mocked as well. `ProfilesService.getQuickFacts` just returns a mocked object. ideally I would have been able to create a node API, but I ran out of time.

The templates are not Pixel perfect, sorry about that.
